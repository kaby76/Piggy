# Piggy

_NB Status: Piggy is currently being developed and not available yet._

Welcome to Piggy (*P*/*I*nvoke *G*enerator for C#). This free and open source software
is a pinvoke generator from C++ headers. It is an extremely powerful source-to-source
transformational system that goes well beyond any another pinvoke generator!!
It uses the same basic algorithm of DFS traversal of the
AST commonly used in all pinvoke generators, such as in ClangSharp and CppSharp,
but abstracts the visitor code into _templates_. A template is a combination of a tree
regular expression, intersperced with code and text blocks. The pattern matching also
incorporates Regex matching of AST values, and dynamic string interpolation. Thus, Piggy corrects the issue
of inflexibility you see with other pinvoke generators.

As with ClangSharp and CppSharp, Piggy inputs C files, parsed
by Clang to get an [abstract syntax tree (AST)](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.html).
Piggy reads a specification file that contains passes and templates. Output is generated by a DFS traversal
of the AST, matching the tree with patterns. All C#
code and text blocks in the templates is collected into a C# class, JIT compiled, then executed during a second
traversal.

This tool does not read DLLs for P/Invoke generation,
only the headers.

Piggy extends the ideas of other pinvoke generators:
* [SWIG](http://swig.org/), the original pinvoke generator, which uses a specification file containing type maps.
* [ClangSharp](https://github.com/Microsoft/ClangSharp) [(Mukul Sabharwal; mjsabby)](https://github.com/mjsabby),
 and [CppSharp](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp), which use Clang AST visitors of the Clang-C API.
* [Lumír Kojecký's](https://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=9709944)
 [CodeProject article for dynamically compiling and executing C# code in the Net Framework](https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/715891/Compiling-Csharp-Code-at-Runtime).
* [Clang-query](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang-tools-extra/tree/master/clang-query),
which was used as a starting point for serializing an AST (the XML serializer no longer exists).
* [Jared Parsons' PInvoke Interop Assistant](https://github.com/jaredpar/pinvoke),
which is another open-source pinvoke generator.
* [xInterop C++.Net Bridge, by Shawn Liu](https://www.xinterop.com/). Commercial product, no longer available.

## Piggy Specification File

Instead of using and extending the unwieldy command-line arguments for input,
Piggy uses a specification file. This file specifies what options to use
for Clang and C# code generation. The grammar and parser for the specification file is for Antlr, a
high quality parser generator.

For an example of the Piggy specification file, see the Enums example in the root directory. There are two files,
m.pig and basic.pig. The m.pig file sets up the Clang input: C files and compiler options. Then, it includes
the main specification file basic.pig. In that file, multiple passes are specified in order to generate enums and 
function pinvoke declarations. The example demonstrates some very important featuers: Kleene star tree expressions,
dynamic string interpolation for selecting only "clang-c" directories.

### Spec file grammar

For the latest Antlr grammar files describing the input into Piggy, see
[SpecParser.g4](https://github.com/kaby76/Piggy/blob/master/Piggy/SpecParser.g4)
and [SpecLexer.g4](https://github.com/kaby76/Piggy/blob/master/Piggy/SpecLexer.g4).

(Note: I highly recommend using my [AntlrVSIX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KenDomino.AntlrVSIX) plugin for reading and editing Antlr grammars in Visual Studio 2017!)

## Building Piggy ##

Download [llvm](http://releases.llvm.org/7.0.0/llvm-7.0.0.src.tar.xz),
 [clang](http://releases.llvm.org/7.0.0/cfe-7.0.0.src.tar.xz),
 and [clang extra](http://releases.llvm.org/7.0.0/clang-tools-extra-7.0.0.src.tar.xz).

Untar the downloads. Then,
~~~~
 mv llvm-7.0.0.src clang-llvm               # rename directory to "llvm"
 mv cfe-7.0.0.src clang-llvm/tools/clang;   # move and rename directory to "clang" 
 mv clang-tools-extra-7.0.0.src clang-llvm/tools/clang/tools/extra  # #move and rename
~~~~
Build using cmake (see [instructions](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)).
~~~~
mkdir build; cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64 -Thost=x64 ..\llvm
msbuild LLVM.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
~~~~
Once you have built LLVM and Clang, you can build Piggy. Make sure to map e:/ to the
location of clang-llvm/.
